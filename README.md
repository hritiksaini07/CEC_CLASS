# CEC_CLASS
This repository consists of the programs based on different patterns that can be implemented using Python code.
These patterns are demonstrated with the use of different iterating conditions like for loop or while loop.
Program number 1-14 are triangular patterns which are implemented in two different forms same pattern once with the star and other time with the numbers.
Program number 15-17 are diamond pattern question implementing diamond shape using with stars and numbers.
This file also include programs based on based where each file name depicts the type of sorting that program is made for.
